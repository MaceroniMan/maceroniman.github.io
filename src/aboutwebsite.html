  <p>This website is based off an older <span class="yellow">Curses</span> text based menu. It was made with pure HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
  
  <p>This website is also a <span class="yellow">single page</span> application. You may have noticed that when you click a link, the page does not reload. This website uses <span class="yellow">JQuery</span> to dynamically grab the requested HTML and put it on the page, allowing the website to handle its own loading screens and load all content dynamically.</p>
