  <p>Greetings, fellow code whisperers! I'm <span class="yellow">Jack Neils</span>, a computer science enthusiast on a mission to understand the world through a computer screen.</p>
  
  <p>Over my many years of befriending keyboards I have gained many computer related skills. My most familiar programming languages are <span class="yellow">Python 3</span>, <span class="yellow">NodeJS</span>, <span class="yellow">SQL</span> and <span class="yellow">Java</span>.</p>
  
  <p>Along with my primary programming skills, I have secondary skill levels in other languages such as <span class="yellow">PowerShell</span> and <span class="yellow">Bash</span>, <span class="yellow">C++</span>, <span class="yellow">C#</span> as well as the <span class="yellow">Web Trifecta</span>.</p>

  <p>Now all software needs its other half, and I have npt neglected hardware I tinker with <span class="yellow">Raspberry Pis</span> quite a bit, as well as interesting bits and pieces I find online. Along with hardware comes operating systems; I spend a considerable chunk of my time poking around inside of the <span class="yellow">Linux OS</span>, with my favorite flavor being <span class="yellow">Kali Linux</span>.</p>
  
  <p>With <span class="yellow">Kali Linux</span> comes one of my favorite pasttimes, <span class="yellow">hacking</span>. My passion is <span class="yellow">Cybersecurity</span>, with this passion comes many hours of sitting with a metaphorical hoodie on hacking away at cyber ranges, testing tools and cracking codes.</p>
  
  <p><span class="yellow">Network Infrastructure</span> is another hobby of mine. Troubleshooting <span class="yellow">DHCP</span>, <span class="yellow">DNS</span> and anything else network-related feels almost superhuman. <span class="yellow">Web servers</span>, <span class="yellow">DNS sinkholes</span> and even <span class="yellow">subnetting networks</span> feels like a brave quest... just without without the pesky 'prophesy' part of quests.</p>

  <p>Lastly, it should be known that I do in fact 'see the sun'. When I am not staring deep into the 1s and 0s, I am <span class="yellow">skiing</span>, <span class="yellow">hiking</span>, <span class="yellow">biking</span> and anything else that happens outside. Starting campfires and roasting marshed mallows with the crisp fall air is my ideal way to end a week.</p>
  <p></p>
